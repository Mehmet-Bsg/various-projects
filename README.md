# various-projects
Some of my code projects I've done during my scholarship at Mines Paris

Everything was done in the form of notebooks

In the file 'ML' you will find some of the practical work i've done for my course on deep learning for image analysis.

In the file 'End-of-year-IT-project' you will find the code of my first year informatic project which consisted in the implementation of the poisson image editing technique.
