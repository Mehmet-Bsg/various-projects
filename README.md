# various-projects
Some of my code projects I've done during my scholarship at Mines Paris

In the files 'classification_practical' and 'segmentation_practical' you will find some of the practical work i've done for my course on deep learning for image analysis.

In the file 'End-of-year-IT-project' you will find the code of my first year informatic project which consisted in the implementation of the poisson image editing technique.
